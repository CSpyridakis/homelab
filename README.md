# Homelab

## General Notes
This repository serves as the primary documentation point for my **Homelab**.

The **Homelab** project is an on-premises infrastructure that accommodates the networks and devices I use for experimenting with new technologies or providing private area self-hosted services. This approach ensures that the data created is stored on proprietary devices, providing a safe testbed for learning, before applying similar principles in the field. 

In this repository: [https://github.com/CSpyridakis/notes](https://github.com/CSpyridakis/notes), you can find general notes on various technologies. Some of these notes are relevant to the creation and maintenance of this **Homelab**.

*TODO:* In the future, this repository will also include relevant configuration files.

For quick access and an at-a-glance overview of the **Homelab**'s status, I use the [homepage dashboard](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage). You can find my configuration for this dashboard in the following repository: https://github.com/CSpyridakis/homepage.

Regarding my Desktop Workstation, which is one of the devices in this network, I use an Ubuntu Desktop system as my daily driver. My personal collection of dotfiles is also available here: [https://github.com/CSpyridakis/dotfiles](https://github.com/CSpyridakis/dotfiles).
