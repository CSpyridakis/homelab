## üóíÔ∏è General Notes

This repository serves as the primary documentation hub for my **Homelab**.

**Homelab** is a personal project ‚Äî an on-premises private infrastructure that hosts the networks and machines I use for experimenting with new technologies or providing private, self-hosted services. This approach ensures that data is stored on proprietary devices, offering a secure testbed for learning before applying similar principles in the field.

In this repository: [https://github.com/CSpyridakis/notes](https://github.com/CSpyridakis/notes), you can find general notes on various technologies. Some of these notes pertain to the creation and maintenance of this **Homelab**.

For quick access and an at-a-glance overview of the **Homelab**'s status, I use the [homepage dashboard](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage). My configuration for this dashboard is available in the following repository: [https://github.com/CSpyridakis/homepage](https://github.com/CSpyridakis/homepage).

Regarding my Desktop Workstation, which is one of the devices in this network, I use an Ubuntu Desktop system as my daily driver. This is my main device for development. One of the most important aspects is the applications I use and their configurations. Therefore, my personal collection of dotfiles is also available here: [https://github.com/CSpyridakis/dotfiles](https://github.com/CSpyridakis/dotfiles).

## üåê Router

In my setup, three different routers are used, each with its own subnet and purpose:

A. The first is my `ISP modem/router`, which provides network connectivity to all the apartments in my building.

B. The second is my `Home network` router, which provides internet access to general home devices such as smart TVs, IP cameras, and sensors. It also hosts the guest network.

C. Finally, there is my **Homelab** network router, which connects all the devices related to this project.

Both my Home and **Homelab** routers are MikroTik routers, which means they can be strictly configured based on my needs.

As can be easily inferred, my **Homelab** exists behind a NAT. However, for various reasons, I need to access my **Homelab** from anywhere in the world. One of my design rules, however, is to avoid exposing any services directly to the internet.

To achieve this, I use one of the `VPN Services` along with the `IP Cloud` feature provided by `MikroTik` to create a VPN tunnel for secure access to my network. To complete the setup, the proper ports must also be forwarded through the other two routers.

Below is a screenshot from `Winbox` that provides a general understanding of the **Homelab** network.

## **Homelab** devices

### üñ•Ô∏è 1. Main Server
The role of my main server, at this point 

#### Proxmox
[Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) is used as my [Œ§ype 1](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-type-1-and-type-2-hypervisors/) [Hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor). 

![proxmox screenshot](./doc/proxmox.png)

##### üñ•Ô∏èüñ•Ô∏è A. Virtual Machines
Multiple VMs are created using Proxmox to run experiments that follow [IaaS]() printiples before continuing experiments in other infrastructus, either private or public. 

##### üê≥ B. Portainer
The docker-compose files that have been used for some of the services, are available here: [https://github.com/CSpyridakis/dockerfiles](https://github.com/CSpyridakis/dockerfiles).

[Duck DNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) is used to create the with the help of [Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for the Certificates.

##### C. Services
###### ü§ñ C.1 [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
Moreover, modelfiles are available here: [https://github.com/CSpyridakis/modelfiles](https://github.com/CSpyridakis/modelfiles).
